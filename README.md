# Banking-Domain-Dashboard-
I have developed a comprehensive project in Excel , jupyter notebook  and PowerBi . This process  involved several stages including  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) , data preprocessing , data cleaning and data visualization . 
## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective
Develop a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and understand how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers.

## Dataset used 

## Tech stack 

The dashboard was built by using following tools and technologies :

â€¢	Excel â€“ to get raw data details

â€¢	Jupyter Notebook -  to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 

â€¢	Power Query â€“ data transformation and cleaning layers for reshaping and preparing the data 

â€¢	DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) â€“ used for calculated measures and conditional logics 

## Features / Highlights 

â€¢	Goal of the dashboard - With our dashboards which are created using Power BI latest tools helps the company to make a decision based on the applicantâ€™s profile like if the applicant is likely to repay the loan then approving the loan otherwise not.

â€¢	Visuals used 

Stacked bar chart -  to visualize the loan and deposit by each occupation

Clustered column chart

Slicers 

Donut chart

â€¢	Business impact and insights -  The Power BI-based risk analytics dashboards enable banks to make data-driven lending decisions by assessing applicant profiles, reducing loan default risks. They provide valuable insights into customer behaviour, loan distribution, and bank performance, supporting strategic planning and client acquisition.
